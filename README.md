DCIT 301 – Process Scheduler System

📌 Project Overview

The Process Scheduler System is a CPU scheduling simulation developed as part of DCIT 301 (Operating Systems). The project implements and evaluates traditional CPU scheduling algorithms and introduces an intelligent scheduling approach aimed at improving performance in dynamic workloads.


The system allows users to simulate process execution, observe scheduling behavior, and analyze performance metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository



git clone https://github.com/Cedric-Raichand/DCIT-301-PROCESS-SCHEDULER-SYSTEM.git

2. Navigate to the project directory



cd DCIT-301-PROCESS-SCHEDULER-SYSTEM

3. Install required dependencies



pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application



python main.py



📊 Performance Metrics Evaluated

1. Average Waiting Time

2. Average Turnaround Time

3. CPU Utilization

4. Throughput


These metrics are used to compare the effectiveness of each scheduling algorithm.



🧪 Testing Methodology

The system was tested using simulated workloads with varying arrival times and burst durations. Each scheduling algorithm was evaluated using identical inputs to ensure fair comparison.



🚧 Limitations

Assumes CPU-bound processes only

Limited machine learning complexity

Does not fully simulate I/O blocking or multi-core environments




🔮 Future Enhancements

Integration of advanced machine learning models and Artificial Intelligence 

Support for real-time and priority-based scheduling

Web-based visualization dashboard

Multi-core CPU scheduling simulation
